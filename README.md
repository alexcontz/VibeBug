# VibeCoding Flutter Experiment

This repository is an experimental Flutter project built from scratch using **VibeCoding** tehniques along with **Prompt Engineering**, leveraging **GitHub Copilot** and **Claude 3.5 (Sonnet)** for code generation. The goal was to test how AI-assisted coding performs when creating a small Flutter app from scratch, track errors, and evaluate measurable results based only off of its code quality.

## Experiment Overview

- **Tools Used:** GitHub Copilot Pro + Claude 3.5 (Sonnet)
- **Project Scope:** Basic Flutter app from scratch
- **Prompts:** Started with simple, generic prompts, then moved to more specific instructions
- **Lines of Code Generated:** ~1000
- **Errors Generated:** ~90
- **Observation:** The AI began producing increasingly incorrect code after 2 prompts and often requested and required manual correction.

## Test Results

| Metric                         | Result |
|--------------------------------|--------|
| Lines of code generated        | 1000   |
| Total errors / issues detected | 90     |
| Compile-time errors            | 70     |
| Runtime exceptions             | 30     |
| Prompts required               | 10     |
| Prompts before AI got "lost"   | 2-3    |
| Manual intervention needed     | 80%    |
(Results are approximate)

> ⚠️ The AI was able to generate code quickly, but the high error rate and instability highlight that significant human oversight is still massively required.
